        <p> It is a social species, but a <em>solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.</em> Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. <strong> It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. </strong>.</p>
